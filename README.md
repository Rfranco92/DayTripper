# DayTripper

	Day tripper is a Reach application whose is to aid in plan in day/road trips. Using the google maps api for planning, a mongo database for user specific data, and passport for user authentication to create a more personal experience. 

	At the moment the app only produces a map of the course you plot plus a google streetview of your destination. Additionaly, a time frame is provided for how long your trip will take aproximately. Planned improvements include the provision of actual directions, mulitple stop trips, an improved ui including points of interest, rest stops, hotels, ect..  

	Heroku coming soon.
